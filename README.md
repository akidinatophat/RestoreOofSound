ATTENTION: this script will not work until my website comes back online. sorry about that

# RestoreOofSound
just a batch script to change the roblox oof sound for the 32-bit client

if you wanna do it manually(you need an old roblox version for this): https://youtu.be/tc8i9mU9aKk

instructions:
1. Download the v2(or v1, but when roblox updates, v1 will stop working) release .bat file.
2. Click
3. Wait for it to run
4. Check your roblox client
5. done

if you get prompted by smartscreen saying "windows protected your pc", click learn more > run anyway. if it was actually harmful
it would be dumb to make this open-source. check the code for yourself and see.
